  <h2>Video of the Crash</h2>

  <p>
    Watching the crash helps explain how fast and dangerous downhill skiing really is. </p>

  <p class="reflection">
    Using a video embed was straightforward because YouTube provides the code.
    It fits this story because the speed and violence of the crash are hard to imagine
    through words alone. Seeing the moment makes it more real and keeps the audience
    engaged longer than just reading about it.

    Adding audio was difficult, but after finding an audio clip, I was provided the code to embed the audio.
    It also helps engage people who might be scrolling but still willing to listen.

  <h3>Social Media Reaction</h3>

  <p>
    Crashes like this spread quickly on social media as fans and reporters react in real time.

  <p class="reflection">
    Instead of fully embedding a post, I used a link because it was simpler and still effective.
    Social media fits this story because people immediately react to crashes with concern,
    updates, and opinions. Linking out lets audiences explore the conversation themselves.
